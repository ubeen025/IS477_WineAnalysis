MissingOutputException in rule visualization_export in file /Users/danielchoi/Desktop/IS477 project/is477-sp24-Choi_Oh/Snakefile, line 25:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
Visualization Results/image_1.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Visualization Results/image_2.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Visualization Results/image_3.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Visualization Results/image_4.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Visualization Results/image_5.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Visualization Results/image_6.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
